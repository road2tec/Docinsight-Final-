MERN Intelligent Document Processing System
Project Goal:
Build a full-stack Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system using the MERN stack, with OCR, NLP, and AI-powered querying. The system should allow users to upload PDFs, extract text and tables, process content with NLP models, enable semantic search and Q&A, and generate downloadable reports.

Step 1: Project Setup & Structure
text
Create a MERN project with the following structure:

/mern-idp
  /client          # React frontend
  /server          # Node.js + Express backend
  /workers         # Python/Node workers for OCR & NLP
  /docker-compose.yml
  /README.md
Step 2: Backend Setup (Express + MongoDB)
text
Set up a Node.js + Express backend with:
- REST API or GraphQL endpoints
- MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- JWT authentication with OAuth2 support
- File upload handling using Multer
- Integration with AWS S3/MinIO for file storage
- Redis + BullMQ for job queueing
Key Models (MongoDB Schemas):

User: { name, email, passwordHash, role, createdAt }

Document: { userId, filename, s3Url, uploadDate, status, metadata }

Page: { documentId, pageNumber, extractedText, ocrConfidence }

Extraction: { documentId, extractionType (text/table), data, processedAt }

Vector: { documentId, embedding, vectorId, modelUsed }

Step 3: Frontend Setup (React + Tailwind)
text
Create a React app with:
- React Router for navigation
- Zustand/Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Drag-and-drop PDF upload component
Key Screens:

Dashboard: Show recent documents, stats, and quick actions.

Upload Page: Drag-and-drop PDF upload with progress bar.

Document Viewer: View extracted text, tables, and metadata.

Chat Interface: Ask questions about the document with AI responses.

Reports Page: View auto-generated charts and export options.

Admin Panel: Manage users and access.

Step 4: OCR & Table Extraction Worker
text
Create a Python/Node worker that:
- Uses layoutparser + Tesseract for OCR
- Extracts tables using Camelot/Tabula
- Saves extracted text and tables to MongoDB
- Publishes processed events to Redis queue
Step 5: NLP Processing & Embeddings
text
Integrate spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers for:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text summarization
- Keyword extraction
- Sentence embedding generation using sentence-transformers
- Store embeddings in Pinecone/Milvus vector DB
Step 6: ChatGPT Query System
text
Implement a chat system that:
- Takes a user query + document context
- Uses OpenAI ChatGPT API or local LLM (via Hugging Face)
- Retrieves relevant document sections using semantic search
- Returns human-like answers with citations
Step 7: Reporting & Export
text
Create a reporting module that:
- Generates visual summaries (bar charts, word clouds)
- Exports data to PDF/Word using libraries like pdfkit or docx
- Allows custom report templates
Step 8: Security & DevOps
text
Implement:
- HTTPS, secure JWT tokens, encrypted S3 buckets
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Docker containers for each service
- Kubernetes deployment YAMLs
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-based config management
Step 9: Testing & Validation
text
Write tests for:
- API endpoints (Jest + Supertest)
- OCR accuracy and table extraction
- NLP entity recognition
- Chat response relevance
- Frontend component rendering
Step 10: Deployment
text
Deploy using:
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes for production
- AWS/GCP/Azure cloud services
- MongoDB Atlas for DB
- S3-compatible storage
